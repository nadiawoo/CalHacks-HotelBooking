# CalHacks 12.0 Hackathon Project - AirBnB but make it more convenient 
This project hopes to create a AI-implemented app that helps the user to plan their itineraries without having to *CONSTANTLY* switch between tabs and windows for comparison or *INCESSANTLY* cross-referencing to-dos with accomodation location. 

## Goals 
- [] Create UI
- [] AI Implementation
  - [] Location planning
  - [] Itinerary suggestions
  - [] Forming comparisons with selected accomodations
- [] Pull from AirBnB API
